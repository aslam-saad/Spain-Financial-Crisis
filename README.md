## Research Case: The Spanish Financial Crisis and its Impact on the Economy

### Introduction

The Spanish financial crisis, which originated in 2006 and was exacerbated by the global financial crisis in 2008, resulted in Spain's most severe recession in the democratic era. Analyzing data from 2000 to 2018 provides valuable insights into the causes and consequences of this crisis.

### Research Objective

This research aims to examine the sequences and causes of the Spanish financial crisis by analyzing key economic indicators and identifying the impacts on the economy.

### Data Collection

Data was collected from reputable sources such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for specific indicators related to Spain's economy from 2000 to 2018. The dataset includes the following 12 indicators:

1. Time (Years between 2000 - 2018)
2. GDP Growth
3. Unemployment Rate
4. Short-term Interest Rate
5. Headline or CPI Inflation Rate
6. Total Investment as a percent of GDP
7. Gross National Savings as a percent of GDP
8. Current Account Balance as a percent of GDP
9. Fiscal Deficit (General government net lending as a percentage of GDP)
10. Fiscal Debt (Gross public debt; Maastricht criterion as a percentage of GDP)
11. Debt Service (Net general government interest payments as a percentage of GDP)
12. Recessionary or Inflationary Gaps (Output gap as a percentage of potential GDP)

### The Impact of the Crisis

To understand the impact of the Spanish financial crisis, several key indicators were analyzed. Visualizations were created to provide a clearer representation of the data.

#### Output Gap

The output gap, which illustrates the difference between a country's actual GDP and its potential GDP, was examined. Prior to 2008, Spain had an inflationary gap, indicating rapid economic growth. However, the global crisis pushed the country into a deep recession. After nearly a decade, Spain began to recover in 2018.

#### Unemployment Rate

The unemployment rate was analyzed in relation to the output gap. Prior to 2008, Spain experienced unexpectedly high rates of unemployment, reaching approximately 9% of the labor force while in a positive gap. During the recessionary gap, unemployment worsened, reaching its peak at 26% in 2013. From 2016 onwards, Spain's economy started recovering, resulting in a 10% decrease in unemployment over five years, reaching a rate of 15% in 2018.

#### Public Debt

The impact of the crisis on public debt was also assessed. Prior to 2008, during the inflation phase, the public debt was relatively low, reaching only 36% of GDP in 2007. However, after 2008, during the recession phase, the debt rapidly increased, peaking at 100% of GDP in 2014. The interest payment on the debt also surged during this period.

#### Current Account Balance

The current account balance, reflecting the difference between savings and spending, was examined. Before 2012, Spain had a significant current account deficit, reaching a maximum of 10% in 2007. This deficit was largely attributed to excessive spending, fueled by the Spanish real estate bubble. After 2012, the current account balance shifted to a surplus as spending declined and savings increased.

### The Causes of the Crisis

Analyzing the data allowed for an examination of the fiscal and monetary policies implemented during different phases of the business cycle, shedding light on the causes of the crisis.

#### Fiscal Policy

The budget balance, representing the difference between government revenues and spending, was analyzed. Before 2008, during the inflationary gap, the budget balance was in surplus, indicating appropriate fiscal policies aimed at curbing overheating growth. During the recessionary phase, expansive fiscal policies were implemented to stimulate growth and overcome the deep recession.

#### Monetary Policy

The real interest rate, calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate, was assessed. During the inflationary gap, a restrictive monetary policy should have been adopted, including an increase in interest rates. However, the interest rates in Spain remained low, even reaching negative values, which contributed to the formation of the Spanish real estate bubble.

### Conclusion

By analyzing data from the Spanish economy between 2000 and 2018, valuable insights were gained regarding the sequences and causes of the Spanish financial crisis. The study revealed two distinct economic situations: inflation before 2008 and a deep recession thereafter. The low interest rates and a booming real estate market led to the Spanish real estate bubble, which was followed by the global financial crisis. The crisis resulted in a significant increase in public debt, a surge in unemployment rates, and a decline in economic growth. However, after 2016, the Spanish economy began to recover.
